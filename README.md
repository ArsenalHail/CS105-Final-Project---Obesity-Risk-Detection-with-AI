# CS105-Final-Project---Obesity-Risk-Detection-with-AI

My final project for CS105, an introduction to AI course. This is a script which takes in data that links obesity to features found in individuals from a UCI dataset and determines if a random individual with features has a high risk of developing diabetes. Credit to Anthony Montano, Fabian Gutierrez, and Jacob Korte for developing alongside me (Alex Camilleri) and for being excellent project partners.

The script utilizes Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK to implement K-nearest neighbors as well as K-means clustering. Precision, recall, accuracy, and the F1 score are generated and shown with mathplotlib. More information on how the script functions can be found in the pdf within the repository.
